### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Sandra  M.

I have a BA in Philosophy with a minor concentration in sociology. I have always been interested in the topics of social progress, inclusion and justice. The way I found to make a concrete contribution to these fields was through education. I have studied neuroscience and its applications to education in particular. I deeply believe in the power of technology to impact social lives in a positive way.
